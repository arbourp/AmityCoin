#### About AmityCoin

We at Calex believe in project AmityCoin; so much so that we launch with no Premine. AmityCoin aims to change the status quo; to be accepted anywhere good and services are rendered. We believe with this ethos the value of AmityCoin will speak volumes about itself.  Please, join us in shaping the future! We are a unique, CryptoNote privacy coin that aims for fair mining and distribution for decentralisation. We use a unique algorithm called CryptoNight Soft Shell created by our good friends over at TurtleCoin. Soft Shell is a novel adaptation to the Cryptonote hashing algorithm. By dynamically adjusting the scratchpad and memory utilization, we present a CryptoNote coin more ASIC resistant than those which preceed it. At the present time there are is no compatible pool software or GPU-enabled miners, ensuring a more natural growth and network decentralization. During our testing phase, even a moderately powered computing device stood a 'fair' chance of solving a block enabling a truly fair mining experience.
